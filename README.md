# chat
Created a video and text chat application using WebtRTC and SocketIO that allows for easy, 2 person communication.
 Made it just to learn about video chat and WebRTC.

Try it with a friend [here!](https://simple-chat1234.herokuapp.com)

Simply click on the link and send the link to your friend as well. 

For Google Chrome, WebRTC policies have changed so all applications using WebRTC have to be served over https, I bypass creating my own cert and private key by using Heroku, but I've added another index.js file called httpsindex.js for those who want to make and pay for their own certs.

## WebRTC is currently supported on these desktop browsers:
Google Chrome  
Firefox  
Opera  
Microsoft Edge
